Unfortunately, the game is no longer available on the official LEGO website, as they removed a lot of their flash content in 2017[^2^]. However, you can still play it on some other websites that host flash games, such as NuMuKi[^1^] or SoundCloud[^3^]. To play the game on these websites, you need to have a browser that supports flash, such as Internet Explorer or Firefox. You also need to enable flash on your browser settings and allow it to run on the website. Alternatively, you can download a flash player program such as Adobe Flash Player or SWF File Player and use it to open the game file on your computer.
 
Here are some tips and tricks to help you play Ninjago Spinjitzu Spinball Full Version online:
 
- Use your mouse to click and drag your spinner to aim and fire it. You can also use the arrow keys to adjust your aim.
- Try to hit the portal as soon as possible, as it will give you more points and time.
- Collect as many bolts as you can, as they will increase your score.
- Look for power-ups that will boost your attack, speed, or defense. Some of them are hidden inside objects that you need to break.
